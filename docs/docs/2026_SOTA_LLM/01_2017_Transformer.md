### 2021 RoPE: Rotary Positional Embeddings

- First introduced in the paper [RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding (Su et al., 2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09864)
    - Represent a fundamental shift from adding positional information to **rotating** it within the attention mechanism 

- The Mathematical Core: Complex Rotation
    - The fundamental innovation of RoPE is that it encodes absolute position by applying a rotation to the query ($q$) and key ($k$) vectors in a way that their dot product depends only on the **relative distance** between them

- For a 2D vector $x = [x_1, x_2]^\top$, RoPE applies a rotation matrix $R_{\Theta, m}$ based on the token's position $m$:

$$ R_{\Theta, m} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(m\theta) & -\sin(m\theta) \\ \sin(m\theta) & \cos(m\theta) \end{pmatrix} $$

- When applied to a query $q$ at position $m$ and a key $k$ at position $n$, the attention score (dot product) becomes:

$$ q_m^\top k_n = (R_{\Theta, m} q)^\top (R_{\Theta, n} k) = q^\top (R_{\Theta, m}^\top R_{\Theta, n}) k = q^\top R_{\Theta, n-m} k $$

- This mathematical identity proves that the model effectively ignores absolute position and focuses strictly on the relative distance $\Delta = n-m$

- High-Dimensional Implementation
    - In modern LLMs, the hidden dimension $d$ is broken into $d/2$ pairs of 2D subspaces. 
    - Each subspace $j$ is rotated at a different frequency $\theta_j$:
    
    $$\theta_j = 10000^{-2j/d} \qquad j \in \{0, 1, \dots, d/2 - 1\}$$
    
    - Low-index dimensions rotate quickly (fine-grained local position), while high-index dimensions rotate slowly (coarse long-range position)

- Scientific Properties & Benefits
    - **Long-Term Decay:** A critical property of RoPE is that as relative distance $|m-n|$ increases, the expected value of the dot product between query and key vectors naturally decreases. This mimics human language, where nearby words usually have more mutual relevance than distant ones
    - **Context Extrapolation:** Because RoPE uses a continuous functional form (sine/cosine) rather than a learned lookup table, it can handle sequence lengths (e.g., 128k or 1M tokens) that were never seen during the initial training phase
    - **Optimization Stability:** By isolating position into the attention mechanism rather than mixing it with semantic signal in the hidden state, RoPE prevents "positional memorization" and improves gradient flow in deep networks





### 2019 RMSNorm: Root Mean Square Layer Normalization

- The Timeline
    - [LayerNorm (2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06450): Proposed by Jimmy Lei Ba, et al. (University of Toronto). It was designed to solve the internal covariate shift in RNNs and later became the backbone of the 2017 Transformer.
    - [RMSNorm (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07467): Proposed by Biao Zhang and Rico Sennrich. It gained massive popularity around 2023–2024 with the Llama series and is now the default for almost all high-performance LLMs in 2026.

- **LayerNorm (LN)**
    - LayerNorm centers the activations by subtracting the mean and then scales them by the standard deviation. For an input vector $x$ of dimension $d$:

    $$ \mu = \frac{1}{d} \sum_{i=1}^{d} x_i, \quad \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{d} \sum_{i=1}^{d} (x_i - \mu)^2 + \epsilon} \\[5pt]
    \bar{x}_i = \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sigma } \cdot \gamma_i + \beta_i $$

    - **$\gamma$ (gain)** and **$\beta$ (bias)** are learnable parameters.
    - **The Cost:** Calculating $\mu$ requires a full pass over the data, and subtracting it requires another, making it computationally more "expensive" for hardware to parallelize.

- **RMSNorm**
    - The authors of RMSNorm hypothesized that the **re-centering** (subtracting the mean) wasn't actually providing the stability—it was the **re-scaling**. RMSNorm simplifies this by calculating only the Root Mean Square:

    $$ RMS(x) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{d} \sum_{i=1}^{d} x_i^2 + \epsilon} \\[5pt]
    \bar{x}_i = \frac{x_i}{RMS(x) } \cdot \gamma_i $$

    - **The Benefit:** Notice there is no $\mu$ and no $\beta$.
    - **The Efficiency:** It reduces the computational overhead by roughly **10–40%** per normalization layer because it bypasses the mean-offset calculation.

- The Science: Why it works
    - The primary goal of any normalization is to ensure that the "magnitude" of activations doesn't explode or vanish as they pass through dozens of layers.
    - **Invariant Scaling:** RMSNorm provides "re-scaling invariance." If the weights of a layer are scaled by a constant, the output remains normalized, which keeps the gradients stable.
    - **Simplified Geometry:** LayerNorm projects inputs onto a $d-1$ dimensional hyperplane (because of the mean subtraction) and then onto a sphere. RMSNorm simply projects them onto a $d$ dimensional sphere. In high-dimensional LLM space, that extra degree of freedom doesn't hurt performance; it actually helps speed up convergence.
    - **Hardware Friendliness:** In 2026, we optimize for **SRAM-to-Register** bandwidth. RMSNorm requires fewer intermediate variables to be stored in the GPU/TPU cache, allowing for faster "fused" kernels.





### 2020 SwiGLU: Swish-Gated Linear Unit

- Evolution of how models "filter" information:
    - **2017:** ReLU (The "Stone Age" - simple gating)
    - **2020:** GELU (The "Industrial Revolution" - smooth gating, used in GPT-3). [2016 Gaussian Error Linear Units](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08415)
    - **2020-2023:** [SwiGLU](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05202) (The "Modern Era" - introduced by Noam Shazeer; popularized by Llama and PaLM).
    - **2024-2026:** Variations like **dGated Linear Units** are common, but SwiGLU remains the core SOTA backbone for efficiency.


- GELU is a single-branch function:

    $$ \text{GELU}(x) = x \Phi(x) \approx x \cdot \sigma(1.702 \cdot x) $$

    - Where $\Phi(x) = P(X \le x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. It essentially "weights" the input by how likely it is to be "active."

- The SwiGLU Upgrade:
    - SwiGLU is a **Gated Linear Unit (GLU)**. Instead of one linear transformation, it uses two in parallel, where one "gates" the other.
    
    $$ \text{SwiGLU}(x, W, V, b, c) = \text{Swish}_\beta(xW + b) \otimes (xV + c) $$

    - The symbol $\otimes$ denotes element-wise multiplication (Hadamard product).

- In modern SOTA implementations (where we drop the bias $b$ and $c$), the operation is:
    
    $$
    G = \text{SiLU}(xW_1) = (xW_1) \cdot \sigma(xW_1) \\[5pt]
    L = xW_3 \\[5pt]
    \text{output} = (G \otimes L) W_2
    $$

    - Old FFN: $x \xrightarrow{W_{up}} \text{GELU} \xrightarrow{W_{down}} \text{Output}$
    - SOTA FFN: $x \xrightarrow{W_1, W_3} (\text{SiLU}(xW_1) \otimes xW_3) \xrightarrow{W_2} \text{Output}$

- The Science: Why it Wins
    - The "Bilinear" Advantage: Standard activations like ReLU or GELU are fixed functions. SwiGLU is **bilinear**—the "gate" is learned. By having a dedicated weight matrix ($W_3$) for the value branch and another for the gate ($W_1$), the model can more surgically decide which dimensions of the hidden state should pass through.
    - Gradient Flow
        - **ReLU:** Has a "dead zone" for $x < 0$ where the gradient is exactly zero.
        - **GELU/Swish:** Are "stochastic-ish" smooth functions. They allow a small, negative gradient to flow, which helps with optimization.
        - **SwiGLU:** Because it’s a product of two learned projections, it creates a much more complex "loss landscape" that allows the model to learn sharper features during pre-training.
    - Parameter Efficiency
        - While SwiGLU uses **three** weight matrices ($W_1, W_2, W_3$) instead of the two used in standard Transformers, researchers found that the performance gain is so high that you can actually reduce the hidden dimension ($d_{ff}$) and still outperform a larger GELU-based model. 

| Feature | ReLU (2017) | GELU (2020) | SwiGLU (SOTA) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Formula** | $\max(0, x)$ | $x P(X \le x)$ | $(\text{SiLU}(xW) \cdot xV)$ |
| **Shape** | Sharp kink at 0 | Smooth curve | Dynamic/Learned |
| **Gating** | Hard (On/Off) | Probabilistic | Learned Projection |
| **Compute Cost** | Lowest | Medium | High (Extra Matrix) |
| **SOTA Status** | Obsolete | Legacy (GPT-3/BERT) | **Standard (Llama/DeepSeek)** |

- Insight: SwiGLU as "Channel Attention"
    - **The core concept:** SwiGLU is to the **embedding dimension** (channels) what Attention is to the **sequence dimension** (tokens). While the Attention mechanism assigns a weight to each token in a sequence to determine "where" to look, **SwiGLU assigns a weight to each dimension of the embedding vector** to determine "what" signal is valid.
    - In a SOTA FFN (SwiGLU), we use a "neurons guarding neurons" approach:
        - **The Signal ($xW_3$):** A vector (a group of neurons) representing the raw candidate information.
        - **The Gate ($\text{SiLU}(xW_1)$):** Another vector (another group of neurons) that acts as the controller.
        - **The Interaction:** The Gate vector decides which specific neurons in the Signal group are "valid signals" for the current context via element-wise multiplication.
    - Why it’s superior to Old Tech (GELU/ReLU)
        - **Old Tech:** A neuron's validity was a lonely decision based only on its own value ($f(x)$).
        - **SwiGLU:** A neuron's validity is a **collaborative decision**. One group of neurons provides the content, while another provides the contextual filter, allowing for much more surgical "conditional logic" within the model's internal representations.
    - In 2026, this "Feature Gating" is why SwiGLU models feel significantly more "intelligent" and context-aware than the GPT-3 era models of the same parameter count.
